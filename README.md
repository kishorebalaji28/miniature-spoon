SMART BLIND STICK WITH VOICE OUTPUT:
This project is made using ultrasonic to predict the distance on the object in front and to produce a voice output to the blind person to change
direction if any object is detected using python and the respective modules.
It also consists of water sensor to detect any water or wet surface on the ground to prevent slipping.
Arduino output is converted into python output using the respective modules in the python by decoding the arduino output into python readable form and produces a voice output if the object is at a distace less than 50cm,
